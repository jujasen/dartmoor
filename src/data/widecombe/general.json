  "hero": "The beautiful village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor is a well-known Dartmoor tourist attraction welcoming visitors at all times of the year. Widecombe lies in a valley created by the East Webbern river. The name Widecombe is derived from 'Withy-combe' - meaning 'Willow Valley'.",

  "bold": "Your first glimpses of the village of Widecombe in the Moor is of a picturesque little hamlet that nestles snuggly between rolling green hills of Devon farmland, with a spectacular backdrop of granite tors and moorland. The village has a coach and car park, as well as the usual collection of craftshops and tea rooms serving refreshments.",

  "main": "At the centre of the village is a triangular shaped green, with a collection of mature trees. The trees have seating fixed around their trunks, allowing you to sit and relax, whilst you enjoy the stunning views of the church set against a moorland vista. The church of St Pancras is aptly named the 'Cathedral of the Moors'. The church spire is a well known local landmark, visible for many miles. The church was originally built in the 14th century, and enlarged over the following two centuries, partly on the proceeds of the local tin mining trade. Next to the churchyard is Church House built in 1537 as a brew house for the production of church ales. Church House is now managed by the National Trust, having been a brew house, school house and alms house at various times in its history. The old Sexton's cottage is also part of the complex, currently being utilised as a National Trust and Dartmoor National Park Information Centre and shop."
