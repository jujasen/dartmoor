  "title": "Clapper Bridge",

  "hero": "Postbridge's other attraction is the finest example of a clapper bridge in the county.",

  "bold": "The clapper bridge straddles the East Dart River, just twenty meters from the main road bridge (built in the 1780's), and is clearly visible as you drive through the village.",

  "main": "The bridge is constructed from four large granite slabs supported by three granite piers. The large slabs are each over 4m long and 2m wide and weigh over 8 tons each. Clapper bridges are unique to the dartmoor area. There are 30 bridges in total on Dartmoor, being constructed in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by medieval tin workers and farmers as crossings over the many small rivers that traverse the moorland."
