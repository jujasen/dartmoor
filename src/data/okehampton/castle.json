  "title": "Okehampton Caste",

  "hero": "The first documentary evidence of the existence of Okehampton was in AD 980, when the Saxon settlement cross roads, was listed as a place where slaves were freed, so that they could choose their own destiny.",

  "bold": "The Saxon rulers of the area were replaced by the Norman's following 1066 and the invasion of William the Conqueror. The first Norman Serif of the area was Baldwin de Brion, who built the castle as an administrative centre for the large Devon estates that he had acquired.",

  "main": "The Castle is located just outside of the town on top of a wooded hill, in a strategic position that dominated the River Okemont valley and the main route into Cornwall. Okehampton was the largest mediaeval castle to be built in Devon. The main building was destroyed on orders of Henry VIII, after its owner, the Earl of Devon was convicted of treason, but it is still an impressive, and awe inspiring sight. The remains of the building are administered and cared for by English Heritage."
