  "hero": "Set on the southern edge of the Dartmoor National Park surrounded by woods and meadows, the quiet town of Buckfastleigh is best known for the nearby Buckfast Abbey and the South Devon Valley Railway.",

  "bold": "The steam railway follows the old Ashburton line, along the river Dart through Staverton to Totnes, some 7 miles (11km) away. The station in Buckfastleigh is adjacent to the Buckfast Butterfly Farm and the Dartmoor Otter Sanctuary. The Butterfly Farm is a large tropical hot house, where the butterflies fly around in a semi-natural environment.",

  "main": "In the town's churchyard are the ruins of an old 'chantry' chapel and the strange mausoleum erected over the tomb of Richard Carbell in 1677 to contain his 'unquiet spirit'. Richard Carbell was believed by the local population to be in league with the Devil. The local stories of black dogs howling and breathing fire around his tomb are believed to inspired Conan Doyle when he was researching his novel 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'."
