  "title": "Widecombe Fair",
  "hero": "The village of Widecombe in the Moor, is world-famous for its fair, held annually on the second Tuesday in September.",
  "bold": "The Fair gave rise to the well-known folksong 'Widecombe Fair' and the characters of Uncle Tom Cobley and All. The village fair probably began as a simple market, but it has grown over the years into a local institution, with gymkhana, and pony shows, demonstrations, competitions, sheep and cattle shows, numerous sideshows, races and refreshments. The words for the folk song were first published in 1880 by the vicar of a nearby parish, after he heard them sung by a old countryman.",
  "main": "Tom Pearce, Tom Pearce, lend me your grey mare,All along, down along, out along, lee, For I want for to go to Widecombe Fair, With Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all. And when shall I see again my grey mare? All along, down along, out along, lee, By Friday soon, or Saturday noon, With Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all. So they harnessed and bridled the old grey mare All along, down along, out along, lee, And off they drove to Widecombe fair, With Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all. Then Friday came, and Saturday noon, All along, down along, out along, lee, But Tom Pearces old mare hath not trotted home, With Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all. So Tom Pearce he got up to the top o' the hill All along, down along, out along, lee, And he seed his old mare down a-making her will, With Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all.   So Tom Pearce's old mare, her took sick and died, All along, down along, out along, lee, And Tom he sat down on a stone, and he cried With Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all. But this isn't the end o' this shocking affair, All along, down along, out along, lee, Nor, though they be dead, of the horrid career Of Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all. When the wind whistles cold on the moor of the night All along, down along, out along, lee, Tom Pearce's old mare doth appear gashly white, With Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all.   And all the long night he heard skirling and groans, All along, down along, out along, lee, From Tom Pearce's old mare in her rattling bones, With Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all.
