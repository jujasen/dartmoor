  "hero": "Straddling the fast flowing river Tavy below the Western edge of Dartmoor, Tavistock is the centre of a beautiful and fascinating district.",

  "bold": "Tavistock stands in the heart of an area of tremendous natural beauty which ranges from Dartmoor - whose purples, grays, browns and greens are matched by the variety of its moods; now somber and brooding, now sunlit and colourful, now mysterious in a misty cape - to the softly wooded valleys to the North and West of the Town. Nearby is the sea. Thirty miles northwards is the rugged Cornish Atlantic coast with its stark cliffs and often heavy breakers.",

  "main": "A number of buildings scheduled as Ancient Monuments remain to mark the old Abbey. The most picturesque is Court gate, an archway leading from Bedford Square to Guildhall Square. It houses an antiques shop and the oldest private library in Devon. The arch was the main entrance to the Great Courtyard of the Abbey.A section of the cloister walling still stands in the Churchyard, and other parts run along the side of the River Tavy, including the Still Tower where medicines were distilled."
