In 1295 Tavistock gained recognition as a Borough, and sent two Members of parliament to London.The Parish Church of St Eustachius dates from 1318, and in 1467 cloth manufacture in the Town was protected by Statute.In 1525 one of the first printing presses in England was established in the Abbey, and Walton's translation of Boethius de Conolatione was imprinted by Thomas Rychard, a local monk.
